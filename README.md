# Neuroflow Takehome Exercise - Durando Angiulo

## Dev Environment: React Native

(attempted this first in Flutter first but ran into environmental issues so I had to pivot)

- I built this project in React Native as it's what i'm more familiar with. This is an expo project so it should require mimimal setup I'm fairly sure it will just run after installing expo locally

`npm install -g expo-cli`

- the env values for my spotify will be attached in the email I send with this repo link. Slot them into the template and make it a normal .env and the values should populate.

- after booting up the app, on load you will immediately be asked to authenticate with spotify, after doing so, you should be able explore the search bar and details pages.

- If you run into any issues or have any questions please let me know, thank you again for the interview oppurtunity!
